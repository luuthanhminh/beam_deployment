# Core Concepts

This repository contains declarative descriptions of the desired state in the environment and an automated process to make the environment match the described state in the repository.

## How does GitOps work?

### Environment Configurations as Git repository

GitOps organizes the deployment process around code repositories as the central element. There are at least two repositories: the application repository and the environment configuration repository. The application repository contains the source code of the application and the deployment manifests to deploy the application. The environment configuration repository contains all deployment manifests of the currently desired infrastructure of an deployment environment. It describes what applications and infrastructural services (message broker, service mesh, monitoring tool, …) should run with what configuration and version in the deployment environment.

### Pull-based Deployments

The Pull-based deployment strategy uses the same concepts as the push-based variant but differs in how the deployment pipeline works. Traditional CI/CD pipelines are triggered by an external event, for example when new code is pushed to an application repository. With the pull-based deployment approach, the operator is introduced. It takes over the role of the pipeline by continuously comparing the desired state in the environment repository with the actual state in the deployed infrastructure. Whenever differences are noticed, the operator updates the infrastructure to match the environment repository. Additionally the image registry can be monitored to find new versions of images to deploy.
